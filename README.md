# ItemEditor
#### An advanced ItemEditor for the game "CubeWorld" by picroma

This tool allows you to create, edit, and remove any item in a very advanced and detailed way
by either writing the value of each property into the bytes manually or choosing a sample from the dropdowns.

It currently only works with the latest version of CubeWorld (0.1.1),
but I plan to add support for all versions except for the ZirconRealms client.

I still need to get my hands on the pre-release client, so if anyone can help me out with that, please contact me.
